# To-Do-List
In this program, users have the option to create a to-do list, where they can add to the list, view, mark items off, remove from the list, sort items alphabetically, or retrieve the number of items in the list.
Upon opening the program, you will be prompted to choose an option from the menu. 
Option 1 allows you to add to the list, and you will be allowed to type in what you want to add.
Option 2 allows you to review the items in your list. 
Option 3 allows you to add a check to items you have completed. 
Option 4 allows you to remove items from the list. 
Option 5 removes all tasks from the list, clearing it.
Option 6 helps sort the list in alphabetical order. 
Option 7 prints the number of items in your list in all.
